                            Mowasi.com is not an auction house nor a bank, and does not offer auction or banking services. The Site is an online platform allowing for the sale and purchase of items between end-user sellers and buyers. 
                            Membership on the Site is free. Mowasi.com does not charge any fee for browsing, bidding and buying listed items on the Site. Souq.com charges transaction fees to all sellers when their item is successfully sold on the Site, listing fees for classifieds and special listing fees to sellers who use the special listing feature for listing their items. 
                            Sellers must pay all fees due and payable to Mowasi.com after a successful sale and in the case that a buyer does not complete the transaction, the seller may seek a refund of the relevant transaction fees from Mowasi.com by submitting an online no-sale claim. 
                            Before you list an item for sale through the Site, we request you to review the fees that you will be charged based on our Fees & Credit Policy which we may amend from time to time with immediate effect by posting the changes on the Site. 
                            Mowasi.com may choose to temporarily change the fees for our services for promotional events (for example, free shipping days) or new services, and such temporary changes are effective in accordance with their terms when we post them on the Site. 
                            Unless otherwise stated, all fees shall be quoted in your country's currency. You must pay all fees payable to Mowasi.com (and any applicable taxes or charges) within 30 days of the date of any invoice to you from Mowasi.com with a valid payment method as set out in our Fees & Credit Policy . 
                            In case of non-payment of fees and/or any applicable taxes and charges by you to Mowasi.com, without prejudice to any other rights and remedies of Souq.com under this User Agreement or at law, Souq.com without liability reserves the right to:
                            issue you with a warning regarding the non-payment in question.
                            temporarily or indefinitely suspend, limit or withdraw your access to the Site and/or your membership, if you fail to make the outstanding payment within 7 calendar days of Mowasi.com issuing a warning to you.
